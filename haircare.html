<h4 class="lh-3 p-3"> We all want hair that is healthy, glossy, and full of life. Your hair enhances your personality, so it is essential to take care of it the right way. 
While you may not even realize, the little things you do to your hair can damage
 it. A proper hair care ritual might be just what you need to tackle the situation.
</h4>

<h4 id="hfall" class="lh-3 p-3">This article brings you natural hair care tips inspired by age-old Ayurvedic secrets that can do wonders for your scalp and hair health. 
Read on to find out how proper hair care and a healthy diet 
can help you achieve the perfect hair.</h4>



<p  class="display-4 fw-2">Home Remedies For Hair Fall :-</p></h1>
<div class="text-center">
<img src="herbs.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="40%" alt="">
</div>
<h2 class="lh-base mt-3 bg-light fw-2 p-3">1.Scalp Massage:</h2>

<h5 class="lh-base">Massaging your scalp for a few minutes regularly is said to stimulate the scalp and help in improving the hair thickness. Not to mention how massaging your scalp can aid in reducing stress (one of the biggest reasons for hair fall), the advantage is two-fold!
Oiling:</h5>

<h5 class="lh-base">We may risk beginning to sound like a broken record
   at this point, but OIL YOUR HAIR! We recommend Coconut oil and Bringadi
    Oil in particular - they contain fatty acids that penetrate the hair shaft
     and reduce protein loss from the hair. Massage it into your scalp and 
     hair and leave it for at least 1-2 hours, then wash it off. You can also 
     use coconut oil as a leave-in conditioner if your hair does not become oily
      quickly after wash day, it helps improve the luster of the hair.</h5>

<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">2.Aloe Vera:</h2>
<div class="text-center">
  <img src="aloevera.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="40%" alt="">
  </div>
  
<h5 class="lh-base">Aloe Vera is famous for its soothing and healing 
properties! We recommend putting pure aloe vera gel on your scalp and hair 
at least twice a week - it helps calm down an inflamed scalp and reduces dandruff.
 For those of us who have exceptionally oily scalps, aloe vera helps unblock the hair
  follicles blocked by excess oil, thus improving the issue of hair loss due to 
  excessively oily scalp!</h5>


<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">3.Amla:</h2>

<h5 class="lh-base">In Ayurveda, Amla is the most preferred ingredient when it comes to maintaining hair health. It contains heaps of essential fatty acids that help in strengthening 
hair follicles and providing you with the luster you ever need. Rich in vitamin C, potent iron antioxidants, gallic acid, and carotene, Amla can help you in halting premature 
greying and providing blood circulation around the scalp, which indeed stimulates hair growth.
All you have to do is make a paste by mixing lime juice and amla powder and apply it to your scalp and hair. You can keep it on for about an hour and then rinse it off with normal water.
</h5>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">4.Shikakai:</h2>

<h5 class="lh-base">Shikakai remembers our grandmothers as they always insist on using Shikaki for proper hair care, donâ€™t they? It is often considered as a natural alternative to shampoo due to its
 fantastic hair cleansing properties.</h5>
 <h5 class="lh-base">Rich in antioxidants and Vitamin A, C, K and D, Shikakai helps in keeping hair nourished and maintaining hair health. Dry out the Shikakai pods in the sun and then grind them
 to make powder. Take two tablespoons of this powder and mix it with 
 coconut oil in a jar. Massage your hair with the mixture at least twice a week.</h5>

 <h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">5.Reetha:</h2>
 <div class="text-center">
  <img src="reetha.jpg" class="img-fluid p-1 mt-2" width="35%" alt="">
  </div>

 <h5 class="lh-base">Reetha, also known as soapnuts, is another ingredient that has been used in the hair care regime for centuries. It contains saponin, which is responsible for keeping your
 hair healthy and soft.</h5>
 <h5 class="lh-base">You can prepare Reetha shampoo by taking several pieces of soap nuts and Shikakai points and boiling them in half a liter of water. Leave the mixture overnight,
 then strain it and use it as a shampoo.</h5>

 <h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">6.Fenugreek:</h2>

 <h5 class="lh-base">Fenugreek or methi seeds also help in promoting hair growth and repairing hair follicles. It is an excellent ingredient for hair loss and regrowth.
All you have to do is soak methi seeds overnight in water and grind them to a fine paste. Apply the paste all over the scalp and hair. Rinse it off with normal 
water after about half an hour. For best results, do this thrice a week.</h5>

<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">7.Onion Juice:</h2>
<div class="text-center">
  <img src="o.jpg" class="img-fluid p-1 mt-2" width="35%" alt="">
  </div>
  
<h5 id="shair" class="lh-base ">Some of us despise onions for their smell but keep on reading, and they might end up becoming a favourite of yours! Onion juice has been shown to 
successfully treat patchy Alopecia Areata by promoting hair growth and improving circulation! It is simple to apply as well - blend a few onions and squeeze out the juice, 
apply the juice to your scalp and hair, leave it in for 15-20 minutes, 
then rinse it off and shampoo your hair as usual.</h5>


<p  class="display-4 fw-2 p-4">HOW TO GET SMOOTH HAIR?</p>
<div class="text-center">
  <img src="smooth.jpg" class="img-fluid p-1 mt-2" width="30%" alt="">
  </div>


<p class="fs-4 p-2 mt-2 "> For most of us, hair care is an on-going struggle. From taming your frizz to treating dry hair, it is a constant battle waged. 
But these issues can easily be resolved, just by putting in a 
little bit of extra effort.</p>

<p class="fs-4">Hair care doesnâ€™t necessarily have to burn a hole in your pockets. You can easily achieve smooth and frizz-free hair, with only a little care and patience.
 You can certainly save yourself those expensive trips to the salon, and 
 instead opt for more efficient and affordable home remedies.</p>

 <p class="fs-4">The outer layer of your hair keeps it smooth and lustrous.
    Any damage done to the outer layer will make your hair look dull and dry.</p>

    <p class="fs-4">Instead of buying an endless amount of expensive products for your hair, you could instead follow these steps to get smooth, shiny and soft hair, 
right from the comfort of your own home:</p>

A weekly coconut oil massage will keep your scalp and hair happy.</h5>

<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">2.Yoghurt</h2>

<h5 class="lh-base">Good old yoghurt not only makes for appetising â€˜lassiâ€™ but is also great for hair. The lactic acid found in yoghurt acts as a softening agent for hair.
 Apply fresh, unflavoured yoghurt on your tresses, keep on for 20 minutes and wash off with tepid water. You will fall in love with your soft hair.

If you want to make your hair soft, apply banana and honey mask once a week. Mash up 1-2 ripe bananas and add 2 teaspoon of honey.
 </h5>
<h5 class="lh-base">Mix into a paste and use as hair mask. Shampoo the hair after half an hour.
</h5>

Rich in fatty acids, ghee can help deep condition the hair improving its shine, quality and texture. 
Melt a small quantity of pure ghee and give your hair and scalp a good massage with it. Keep it on for a few hours and wash it away with shampoo.
 I is especially suitable for dry and rough hair.</h5>

 <h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">5.Aloe vera and honey</h2>

 <h5 class="lh-base">Aloe vera is a natural conditioner while honey provides hydration. Together, these ingredients will make your hair soft and glossy.

  </div>

<h5 class="lh-base p-2">Honey is an effective natural moisturiser. When it comes to hair, honey not only adds moisture but also helps retain it. 
Using organic honey on the hair will give you healthy and soft hair naturally. Mix 2 tablespoon of pure honey with 3 tablespoon of olive oil and apply on the hair as mask.

<p  class="display-4 fw-2 p-4">Home Remedies to Cure Dandruff Naturally</p>
 
<p id="dhair" class="fs-4">Feeling low on confidence and self-esteem by those tiny flakes constantly falling on your black dress? Well, 
dandruff is something that can hurt your behaviour in public. Dandruff is also medically known as seborrhoea and this condition weakens your scalp primarily 
due to poor hair brushing, stress and dry skin. So now the question is how do you
 put a stop to it?</p>


 <p class="display-4 fw-2 p-4">Dandruff Cure......</p>
 <div class="text-center">
  <img src="dandaruf.jpg" class="img-fluid p-1 mt-2" width="50%" alt="">
  </div>


<p class="fs-4">Now that you have understood the primary cause of dandruff, let us understand how you can put an end to this condition. 
Home remedies can do well to treat dandruff, provided the condition is not severe. If dandruff is severe, then it is advised that you take medical treatment that
 can help resolve this problem. Sometimes, the shampoos you use do not do any good and that is when you will need medical treatment to treat this condition.
</p>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">1.Vinegar</h2>
<div class="text-center">
  <img src="vinegar.jpg" class="img-fluid p-1 mt-2" width="30%" alt="">
  </div>

<h4 class="lh-base">Vinegar helps in treating itchy, dry skin and also helps to kill dandruff-causing fungus and bacteria. The acidic content of vinegar 
is supremely beneficial to drastically reduce flaking.  Apply an equal quantity mixture of white vinegar with water on the scalp skin about half an hour before a head wash."
</h4>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">2.Lemon</h2>

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="l.jpg" class="img-fluid p-1 mt-2" width="30%" alt="">
  </div>

<h4 class="lh-base">This is by far the easiest of them all! Squeeze a full lemon and massage the juice into your scalp. Let it rest for 2 to 3 minutes and rinse off with a regular shampoo. 
You can also add lemon juice to a mug of water and use it as the last rinse post your hair wash session. Regularly repeat it till dandruff disappears. 
The acidic character of the Lemon helps to balance the pH of your hair.</h4>

<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">3.Aloe Vera</h2>
<h4 class="lh-base">Aloe Vera reduces skin irritation and has a moisturizing effect. It reduces flakiness and itchiness and gives relief from dandruff. 
It is antibacterial and antifungal which further protects from dandruff. Apply aloe vera gel directly on your scalp and leave for about half an hour. 
Later wash your hair with a mild shampoo.</h4>

<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">4.Tea Tree Oil</h2>

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="tea.jpg" class="img-fluid p-2 mt-2" width="30%" alt="">
  </div>

<h4 class="lh-base p-2 ">Tea Tree Oil reduces inflammation, itchiness and greasiness. It thus proves to be effective in decreasing dandruff. 
It is both antifungal and antimicrobial. Add around 5 to 10 drops of this oil to your regular bottle of shampoo and shake well. Rinse your hair well after shampooing.
</h4>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">5.Organic Coconut Oil</h2>
<h4 class="lh-base">Organic coconut oil is frequently used to prevent dandruff. It hydrates our scalp and prevents dryness and flakiness, which can increase dandruff. 
It is also antimicrobial and antifungal in nature. Gently massage organic coconut oil on the scalp , leave for a few hours and then rinse using a mild shampoo.
</h4>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">6.Neem</h2>
<div class="text-center">
  <img src="neem.jpg" class="img-fluid p-2 mt-2" width="30%" alt="">
  </div>

<h4 class="lh-base">Antifungal, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of neem help to prevent and treat dandruff. Neem oil can be applied to the scalp and left for a few hours
 to prevent dandruff or you can make a hair mask out of neem. For the hair mask, grind neem leaves into a paste, leave this paste on the scalp for 15 to 20 minutes and
 then use a mild shampoo. You can also boil few neem leaves in water and use it to rinse your hair.
</h4>
 <h2 class="lh-base bg-light fw-2 p-3">7.Fenugreek seeds</h2>
 <h4 class="lh-base">Fenugreek seeds are rich in protein, which prevent dryness, hair fall and dandruff. They also strengthen our hair roots and moisturize our scalp. 
Fenugreek seeds are key to long, thick and beautiful hair. Grind overnight soaked fenugreek seeds into a paste, apply on the scalp and hair, leave for 15 â€“ 20 minutes
