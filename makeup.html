    <h2 class="lh-1  p-4" id="h">HOW TO PREP YOUR FACE FOR MAKEUP  </h2>
<h4 lh-9>Before we get into the best order to apply your makeup, it’s important to work your way through your skin care routine. You don’t need to spend a ton of time on your skin care routine,
 but there are a few simple steps you should take to ensure your skin is ready
 for makeup. Below, three skin care steps to take before makeup.</h4>

<h2 class="lh-base mt-3 bg-light">Step 1: Moisturiser and primer</h2>

<h5 class="lh-base">It is of the utmost importance that your face is moisturised and well hydrated before you apply any makeup onto it. A hydrating cream, in this regard, works excellently since
   it even helps all the following products blend into your skin better.
Then apply a primer, as it not only helps your face stay hydrated, it also enables your makeup to stay on for much longer.
</h5>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light">
Step 2: Apply foundation</h2>
<h5 class="lh-base">
The foundation is one of the most essential elements of your makeup since when correctly applied, it can help provide your face and neck regions with an even-toned, natural appearance. Use a foundation brush, preferably white-tipped, to apply the foundation to your face. Foundation, fundamentally, is of three types viz. liquid, powder, and cream. For those who do not wish to use too much of it, it is recommended that you only apply foundation to regions you wish to even out and leave the rest of your face foundation-free. It is also important that you blend it well with the neck regions so that your face makeup doesn’t come across as out of place with your neck. A quick tip, you can always use the primer to break down the opaque foundation makeup so as to make it appear clearer and blend better.
</h5>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light">
Step 3: Concealing with a concealer
</h2>
<h5 class="lh-base">
Just about everyone thinks they’ve got certain flaws with their face, especially with regards to dark circles. And while accepting one’s flaws is a great thing to do, concealing them doesn’t really make you overtly vain either. The second step of how to do makeup, is learning to apply concealer to the problem areas, especially in the form of a triangle below your eyes. This triangular application helps conceal your dark circles while making your skin appear more naturally even toned and drawing attention towards your eyes.
</h5>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light">
Step 4: Blush, contour and highlight (BCH)
</h2>
<h5 class="lh-base ">
Highlighting and contouring are quick, easy processes that help in taking your makeup game to an altogether new level. Apply the highlighter, cream or liquid based, to your cheekbones, brow bones, on the Cupid’s bow and your chin before you swipe the contour on your cheeks, forehead and along the sides of your nose. Take care to ensure that the contouring doesn’t get too muddy and use an angled brush to blend it all in perfectly. Apply the blush onto the apples of your cheeks, extending upwards to the temple region. Between the blush, contour and the highlighter, different makeup experts recommend different orders of application. While learning how to do makeup, use the order that you’re most comfortable with and one that is most apt for the occasion. Some prefer to apply the blush before the highlighter, especially if the blush is shimmery enough by itself. If you’re using a powder blush, do not ever apply it over a liquid foundation since doing so will cause streaks, making it extremely difficult to blend in.
</h5>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light">
Step 5: The time for eye makeup
</h2>
<h5 class="lh-base ">
Some prefer to do the eye makeup before the blush, contour and highlight routine but it works just as well towards the end. Fill in your brows using an eye pencil before moving on to the eye shadow. Apply an eye shadow shade of your choice and then using a blending brush, preferably a nice fluffy one, dust a softer shade onto the crease and blend outwards. Give your eye makeup the requisite finish with eyeliner or mascara, using a very fine tipped pencil for the waterline and a stiff, angled brush for the lids. The eyes are one place where you can really show off your creativity. So go ahead and put your creative cap on and don't limit yourself while learning how to do makeup.
</h5>
<h2 class="lh-base bg-light">
Step 6: Luscious lips at last!
</h2>
<h5 id="x" class="lh-base">
The lips makeup, with the possible exception of the eyes, are perhaps the most noticed aspect of your makeup. For a quick fix, apply a red, rosy (or any colour of your choice) 
lipstick using a lip brush and you’re good to go. If you’ve got more time, covering the entirety of your lips with a lip liner and following up with a layer of liquid matte lipstick of 
the same colour works wonders for your lips. Finally, use a setting powder or spray to help keep your makeup in place for longer and you’re all set to paint the town red.

        <img src="m.jpg" class="img-fluid p-4" alt="...">

       <h3 class="lh-5"> We're all busy, active people. Whether you're going for a run, attending a fun party, watching a sad movie, or screaming your head off on a rollercoaster, 
        it's nice to not have to worry about whether your makeup is still as put-together as when you first applied it. It can be pretty embarrassing interacting with the world only to 
        discover in the mirror later that your face is slightly melted or you have mascara running down your cheeks.
      </h3>
        <h2 class="lh-5">Here are some smart tips to look great all day, without the need for touch-ups. Follow the guide!
        </h2>
        <img src="moster.jpg" class="img-fluid p-4" alt="">

        <h2 class="lh-5 p-2 ">FOR THE COMPLEXION</h2>
       <h2 class="lh-4 p-4 bg-light  fw-bold"> CLEANSE AND MOISTURIZE YOUR FACE</h2>
      <h4>It is easier to apply foundation to clean and moisturized skin, and the result will be much more natural. Apply a light fluid to your skin (ideally, with an SPF of at least 30) which will allow the foundation to hold well. Caution: avoid greasy creams that will make it run in a flash.
      </h4>
        <h2 class="lh-5 p-4 bg-light  fw-bold">USE A LONG-LASTING FOUNDATION</h2>
        <h4>Choosing the right foundation is essential! Liquid formulas are both
         versatile and suitable for all skin types. Try a long-lasting version,
          which offers impeccable hold for 24 hours.</h4>
        
       <h2 class="lh-5 p-4 bg-light  fw-bold"> SET THE FOUNDATION AND CONCEALER WITH LOOSE POWDER</h2>
       <h4> Loose powder works wonders! It acts as a barrier that seals the makeup. 
        Use a transparent powder and apply it with a large brush all over your face.
         Stay away from compact powders: they contain oil and your makeup won't hold 
         as well.</h4>
        
        
        <h2 class="lh-5 p-4 bg-light  fw-bold">APPLY A LIP PENCIL ALL OVER THE MOUTH</h2>
        <h4>The lip pencil is not only to outline the mouth.
           Colour in your entire lips with a pencil before applying your lipstick. 
           It will serve as a backdrop and keep your mouth coloured all day.</h4>
        
        <h2 class="lh-5 p-4 bg-light  fw-bold">FOCUS ON MATTE LIPSTICKS</h2>
        <h4 > Matte lipsticks are the long-lasting champions.
          Their less greasy composition allows colour pigments to last longer.</h4>
             <h3 class="lh-5 p-4 bg-light  fw-bold"> FOR THE EYES</h3>
        <h2>USE WATERPROOF PRODUCTS</h2>
        <h4>Choose a waterproof mascara that will stand up to all your everyday 
          activities as well as highlight your eyes. Thick, 
          well-designed eyebrows are equally important to boost your look.
           Emphasize them with a colourful gel designed for this purpose, 
           such as TattooStudio Waterproof Brow Gel by Maybelline.</h4>
        
        <h2 class="lh-5 p-4 bg-light  fw-bold" > TRY SETTING SPRAY</h2>
        <h4> In addition to making the products hold longer, a few spritzes of setting spray illuminate the complexion and prevents shine throughout the day. After applying your makeup, simply spray 
        in the shape of a "T" (for the most oily parts of the face) or in 
        the shape of an "X" (for full coverage).</h4>

<h4 class="p-5">We all have our makeup routine that we feel we’ll never stray away from. But what if your everyday routine is actually full of beauty blunders? 
Have no fear: we’re here to help! We took some time to write down the biggest makeup mistakes we’ve discovered over the years and explain why they may be throwing a 
wrench in your routine.</h4>

<h2 class="display-5">Here are our top 5 common makeup mistakes, and of course, how to avoid them.</h2>

 

<h2 class="p-5 fw-bold">1. Applying Before Moisturizing</h2>

<h4>Dry skin is makeup’s worst enemy. Applying makeup directly to dry skin can cause flakiness, which makes it difficult to blend the product into the skin. 
Before applying any makeup, make sure your face is freshly cleansed and moisturized. A moisturizer that can double down as a primer is the best choice. 
To remedy your dry skin long term, make sure to exfoliate weekly!</h4>

 

<h2 class="p-5 fw-bold">2. Too Much Concealer/Not Setting</h2>

<h4>We love concealer as much as the next gal, but be wary of using too much. You should not apply concealer on your entire face. 
Instead, tackle the areas that need correction, such as blemishes and dark spots, with a light layer and build up as needed to avoid accentuating fine lines and wrinkles. 
Opt for more lightweight concealers that still offer good coverage for a more natural and luminous finish.
</h4>
 

<h2 class="p-5 fw-bold">3. Applying Blush Wrong</h2>

<h4>Blush is supposed to add a youthful, rosy touch to our face. If you apply blush wrong - such as too low or too high - you risk aging yourself. 
Smile and apply color to the apples of your cheeks, then blend color back along your cheekbones. This technique creates a glow that doesn’t look clownish. 
For advice on blush placement for specific face shapes, check out this Allure article featuring our Founder, Sarah.
</h4>
 

<h2 class="p-5 fw-bold">4. Wrong Shade of Foundation</h2>

<h4>It’s a makeup mistake everyone has made at some point. Wearing the wrong shade of foundation will automatically give away that you are wearing makeup because your 
face won’t match the rest of your skin. When choosing a foundation, make sure to shade match by testing on your face rather than your arm for the most accurate results.
 It doesn’t hurt to buy two colors that seem close to your skin tone, and either choose the shade that looks best in natural daylight or keep both to mix-and-match as your skin-tone 
fluctuates throughout the seasons.</h4>

 

<h2 class="p-5 fw-bold">5. Filling in Eyebrows Too Dark</h2>

<h4>Lastly, we need to talk about ‘brows. Filling in eyebrows too heavily is perhaps the biggest makeup blunder of all. For blondes, 
filling in your eyebrows with a shade that matches your hair color or even one shade darker looks best. If you have darker hair, 
we wary of going darker on your brows to avoid brows that look harsh. We recommend that you apply your brow product with feathery upward strokes concentrating on sparse or uneven areas,
  rather than uniformly filling in the entire brow, for the most realistic finish. Lastly, lightly comb 
through your eyebrows with a brow brush to smooth out the lines and even out the look. Voila! Great looking brows.
